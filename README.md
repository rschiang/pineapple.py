# Pineapple.py

Files management made easy. Pineapple.py is a set of database-backed functions
that helps you through the difficulties in tracking down duplicate files and
move them elsewhere.

## Prerequisites

Pineapple.py is only tested on Python 3.4 and Peewee (database backend) 2.5.
Install the required libraries by typing the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You might want to use [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) to
prevent messing up your environment.

## Usage

Pineapple.py is pretty straightforward. Import functions and use them in an
interactive interpreter or your own script.
